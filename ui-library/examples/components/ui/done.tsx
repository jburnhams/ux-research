// The completion moment: what a person sees after finishing something that took effort (a
// booking, a submission, an import). It is the one place on an Operate product where the library
// spends its delight budget (character.md §3), so it is a component with rules rather than a
// confetti call:
// - `title` says what happened, in the past tense, with the object: "Booked: 6 pieces in kiln 2".
// - `next` is required. A finish that does not say what happens now is a dead end, however
//   pleasant.
// - `figure` is optional and must be drawn from the person's own data in the subject's terms
//   (their pieces on a shelf, their route on a map), never a stock illustration.
// - The part of the figure that is the person's result enters once, with the `enter-moment`
//   utility (500ms, hard ease-out, no overshoot): their pieces set down on the shelf. Reduced
//   motion makes it instant. Nothing loops and nothing plays a sound.
// - Focus moves to the heading on mount, so keyboard and screen-reader users land on the result.
